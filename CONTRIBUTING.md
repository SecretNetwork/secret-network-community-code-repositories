# ✋ Contributing 

**So you want to start developing the world of web3? That's great, because this is the perfect place to start! 🙌 These community code repositories are designed to (hopefully) be excellent launchpads if you're already knowledable in programming and ready to start creating dApps that add value to your favorite communites.** 

The readme contains a list of all communtity code repositories. These repos will be marked with either a 💰 (repo is unassigned and funding is available), 🧑‍💻 (repo is already assigned), or a ✅ (repo has been completed). If you feel qualified and ready to collect the bounty for an unassigned repo, please submit an issue in **THIS** repository. 

We will primarily use your github profile as the number one source for vetting your qualifications, if you're qualified but don't have a Github profile, please include any details, project, resume, portfolio, that would help us validate your stated qualifications. 

## 📑 Format and Guidelines

- Fork the project.
- Submit 1 PR (pull request) per issue. This makes PRs more manageable and easier to review. 
- Submit a pull request.
  - You should submit the PR to the master/main branch of our repo.
  - You should include the text "Fixes(issue number)" so that Github can auto close the issue for us after we accept the PR. See [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) for more details.

And that's it! We're going to try to keep things as simple as possible as we get started with this new program. If you have any questions, the absolute best thing you can do is ask. If you have any feedback or comments that is always welcome too. 

Welcome to the **future of work**, lets build it together! 😃
